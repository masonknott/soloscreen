SoloScreen
SoloScreen is a minimalist web application designed to provide a distraction-free video watching experience, particularly beneficial for users seeking to study or focus without the interruptions commonly found on mainstream video platforms. By allowing users to submit and watch video links within a simple, clutter-free interface, SoloScreen aims to enhance productivity and concentration.

A very simple project that I made to play around with jquery and ajax, if I wanted to make this a more advanced project with expanded functionality and user interactivity I would most likely switch to using the youtube API to create something totally different but this served it's purpose.

Technologies Used
Laravel: MVC architecture is leveraged.
MySQL:  Laravel's Eloquent ORM is utilized for database interactions 
JavaScript: (with AJAX): For a dynamic user experience, allowing video URL submission without page reloads. AJAX requests handle form submission and content updating seamlessly.
HTML/CSS (with SCSS): SCSS is compiled to CSS using Laravel Mix, enhancing the styling process with variables, mixins, and nested syntax.
jQuery: Simplifies DOM manipulation and AJAX calls
